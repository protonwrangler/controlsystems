The number of motors to suport is a complie-time parameter.

The program can support several control laws each with their own parameters that can be changed at runtime.

Each motor channel can set the rate of control loop processing, in period increments corresponding to integer multiples of the basic 2ms control loop frequency.

The application takes commands that beging with a single letter, possibly followed by parameters. It is anticipated a script or other application could drive the system through a unix command redirection.

Commands
w <delay>               Wait a number of milliseconds
r <path>                Source a file of commands

m <num> <speed>         Set the desired speed of motor #<num> to <speed> rpm
s <num>                 Stop control loop for that motor and set PWM output to zero
g <num>                 Restart control loop processing for a motor
l                       List available control laws and descriptions (letter 'l', not digit 1)
p <motor> <n> <value>   Set the n'th control law parameter of a motor
d <motor>               Print the control law parameters of a motor
